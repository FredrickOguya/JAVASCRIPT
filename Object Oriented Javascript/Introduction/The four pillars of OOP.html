/*
The four pillars are the foundation of OOP. They are:

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Let's take a closer look at each of them.

Abstraction
To abstract something away means to hide away the implementation details inside something â€“  sometimes a function.

Think of a laptop. It has all these crazy boards and technologies inside it, yet we can operate it with just the keys of a keyboard. That is what Abstraction is. Hiding complex implementations and only showing what is really useful. It basically means hiding some elements of an object that shouldn't be global, but showing the rest.

Encapsulation
Encapsulation means that each object in your code should control its own code. The keys, the methods on your object, properties, and so on. If you were to reset a Boolean or delete a key from the object, they're all changes. Encapsulation means combining a bunch of functions and variables into an object and then making that object control them and only them. Code from outside should not be able to mess it up.

Inheritance
Inheritance lets one object acquire the properties and methods of another object. So, we can have an object called Animal which has some properties. Then, we can have a Dog object and a Cat object which both inherit the same properties as Animal. But, they still have their own properties and methods. This can be very useful.

Polymorphism
Polymorphism is connected to Inheritance. It basically means many forms. It says that objects that inherit from the same parent should be able to do different things, even with the same methods. So, if we have a Baby that inherits the method eat() from a Human object and an Adult object that inherits that same method from the Human object, they should do different things. The baby should drink milk and the adult should eat a burger.  It means overriding the methods you just inherited.

 

This might sound like a lot, but we will cover all of this and more! Do not worry, you will get all of it. Good luck!
