Now that we know and understand the fundamentals of JavaScript, it is time to move on to the big guns! We are about to learn the magic of Object Oriented Programming.

Object Oriented Programming is a programming style that is centered around using objects, rather than functions.

In OOP, you write your code in blocks called objects that make your life a lot easier. Once you make them connect and work together, you can make some amazing programs using objects.

With OOP, we can:

Write cleaner code
Make the code simpler
Build reusable blocks of code
Prepare for technical interviews
Use the latest tools in JavaScript
Be an amazing programmer!
In this course, we will start with learning basic information about OOP and the four pillars that make up its foundation. Before we go in-depth, we will first learn what objects are, how to make them, how to use them and how to make sure they are as good as possible. After that, we will learn more complex topics, including connections between objects, inheritance between objects, and lots of other fun stuff.

I hope you enjoy this challenging but very fun course! Take it at your own pace. Don't stress too much if you don't understand something. It took us all lots of time!
