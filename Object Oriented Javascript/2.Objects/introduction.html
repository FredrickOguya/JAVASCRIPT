Introduction

We already talked a bit about objects. Let's define exactly what an object is.

As we said, in real life, anything can be an "object" with its own properties and methods. A car has the properties: model, make, color, miles, and more. It has the methods: start, break, and more.

Let's express these values as name:value pairs, separated by a comma. It would look like this:

model: Audi A6,
color: Gray,
miles: 10,780,
start: () => startEngine(),
break: () => hitBrakes()
This is a lot closer to an object in javascript.

Objects are variable containers that can contain many variables. An object is defined with curly braces {}. It resembles a comma-separated list of  name:value pairs. Here is an example:

{
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 41,
    occupation: "Web Developer",
    car: "Audi A6",
    salary: 120000
}
