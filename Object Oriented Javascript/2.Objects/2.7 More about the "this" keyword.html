/*
When creating methods inside objects that use properties from that object, we have to be careful. For example:

const square = {
    side: 5,
    computeArea = function() {
        return side * side;
    }
}
This should work perfectly, right? Well, believe it or not, this will not work. The reason for that is because the side variable is not a variable. It is a property inside of the object and can only be used as a property. So, how do we access this property? Using the this keyword again.

const square = {
    side: 5,
    computeArea = function() {
        return this.side * this.side;
    }
}
This is saying use the property side from THIS object. The same applies when we are talking about methods:

const human = {
    openEyes: function() {
        ...
    }
    
    wakeUp: {
        this.openEyes();
        
        ...
    }
}
