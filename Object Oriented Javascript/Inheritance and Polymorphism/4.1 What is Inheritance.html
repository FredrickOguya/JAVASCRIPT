What is Inheritance?

Let's write a couple of classes. One for Dog, one for Cat, and one for Monkey. 

We want all of them to have the properties: weight, height, numberOfLegs, dailyFoodIntake. We also want all of them to have the following methods: sleep(), feed().

We also want all of them to have their own special methods. Monkey should have a giveBanana() method, Dog should have a playCatch() method and Cat should have a sleepAllDay() method.

So, we can just write a separate function for each animal and call it a day.


Now, imagine if you had 20 animals or 30 animals. It would be a mess. We do not want to repeat code.

So, we can write a base class called Animal. This class will have all the shared methods and properties between the animals. Then, we can write classes that extend (or inherit) from that class and only add the special methods and properties. That is called inheritance.


This is a very useful concept. It helps you reduce the complexity of code, stops you from repeating code, and makes your program easier to understand.
